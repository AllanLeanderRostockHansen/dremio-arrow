Dremio Arrow Flight Client based on Official examples at https://github.com/dremio-hub/arrow-flight-client-examples/tree/main/python

> Disclaimer: This project is not affliated to [dremio](dremio.com) in any way. It is a tool that I developed while at CIFOR-ICRAF and now we have decided to open source it for wider community use. While I may not have enough time to actively maintain it, the tool is stable enough to sustain future use cases. Besides, community contribution is warmly welcome in form of PRs and forks.
